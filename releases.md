# Release Notes
- [Image Picker 1.2](#image-picker-12)

## Image Picker 1.2

Image Picker `1.2` is not compatible with the old `1.*` versions because significant changes have been made both on the JavaScript and PHP.

Now it's easier to work with the script because of the new structure and helper functions.

Here are some of the new features:

- Multiple image versions
- Upload progress bar
- Rotate image
- Re-Crop previously uploaded image
- Autoload image
- Drag & Drop support
- Better modal and inline integration
- Responsive design
- Better code
- In depth documentation
