__ImagePicker__ is a quick and easy way to upload images for profile avatar, profile header/cover (like YouTube/Google+), generate thumbnails or just when you need a simple but yet powerful image uploader.

You can take pictures with your webcam or phone camera and then you have the option to crop/recrop, rotate or delete.
